# Movie-Ratings-Prediction

This is the CodSoft task 2.

This repository contains a data science and machine learning project designed to predict the ratings of movies. Predicting movie ratings is a challenging and valuable task for recommendation systems and content personalization. The primary objectives of this project are:

Data Collection: Gathering data related to movies, including features such as genre, director, actors, release date, and user reviews.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for machine learning, which includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the model's ability to predict movie ratings.

Model Building: Developing and training machine learning models to predict movie ratings using regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or other suitable models.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics.

Visualization: Visualizing the results and insights from the analysis using libraries like matplotlib.

Contribute: This project is open to contributions aimed at improving the prediction models, expanding the dataset, or enhancing the project's documentation.
